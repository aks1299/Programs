<div>For jQuery you do not really need to set up any environment. As is the case with HTML, you can use any text editor you like. 
You can use the same editor you have used for coding HTML and CSS as well.
The only thing you need to make sure is that you add jQuery library to the page. There are two ways of doing 
this: First way is to add it from external sources like CDN or Google CDN or jQuerys own website or your own server. 
It really does not matter. The second way is to download jQuery library and keep it in the same place as “home.html”. If 
you change the place, you just need to give the proper path of that location. For example, if some developer likes to keep 
this file in a folder named “js”, your path will look like “js/jquerylibrary.js”. In this case, jquerylibrary.js is the name of the 
current version of the library. The name can be anything you like as you are keeping it on your server. However, if you 
are using a hosted version from CDN then you cannot change the filename. Let us see the following example of using a 
hosted version of jQuery file.</div>
