// Define a structure type auto t to represent an automobile. Include components for the make and model (strings), the odometer reading, the manufacture and purchase dates (use another user-defined type called date t ), and the gas tank (use a user-defined type tank t with components for tank ca-pacity and current fuel level, giving both in gallons). Write I/O functions scan date , scan tank , scan auto , print date , print tank , and print auto , and also write a driver function that repeatedly fills and displays an auto structure variable until EOF is encountered in the input file. Here is a small data set to try:
// Mercury Sable 99842 1 18 2001 5 30 1991 16 12.5
// Mazda Navajo 123961 2 20 1993 6 15 1993 19.3 16.7
